# Repository for Exploratory Data Analysis

## Course Project 1 ReadMe
The primary purpose of this repository is to recontruct the graphs of the household energy usage
over a 2-day period in February, 2007.

To do so:
First; download the data from the Electric power consumption data set
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

Second, run the r scripts posted in this github repository that reproduce the graphs plot1, plot2, plot3 and plot4.

###### NB: In each r script, we extracted a portion of data corresponding to the household energy usage over a 2-day period in February, 2007 (the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02).
